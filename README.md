## 🌟 Core Features  

### 🧾 **1. AI-Driven Notice Generation**  
- Auto-generates formatted notice text via a **local AI server (`generate-notice` endpoint)**.

- Dynamically fills **Reference Number**, **Date**, and **Subject** fields.  

### 🖋️ **2. Advanced Signatory Manager**  
- Add, upload, or delete signatories with live table updates.  
- Upload signature images directly or draw using a signature canvas.  
- Signatories persist in **localStorage**, eliminating re-entry on reload.  
- Integrated **delete button** beside dropdown for quick removal.  

### 🎨 **3. Modern Interface & Dual Themes**  
- Elegant **Playfair Display + Roboto** typography.  
- Clean, card-based layout with smooth transitions.  
- Supports **Dark/Light Mode toggle** for accessibility.  

### 📄 **4. Export Options**  
- **PDF Export:** Clean, print-ready official format via `html2pdf.js`.  
- **Word (.docx) Export:** Preserves layout for institutional editing.  
- Auto-formats header banners and signatures in both outputs.  

### 💾 **5. Persistent Local Storage**  
- All signatories, roles, and signatures stored in the browser.
